Such a bizarre movie conceptually, but it's kinda boring in its execution
the phone put more emotion into ringing than Gal Gadot ever did into acting
Ok, I really don't like the direction this movie is going
the moral i learnt from this movie is that women are evil
you can tell this is made by a former sketch comedian because it’s almost entirely setup for one really good bit
Can't think of the last time I've been so frustrated by a movie
It was scary and funny, yes, often at the same time, but it eventually synthesized as a model example of both
The most bizarre, perplexing, confusing cinema experience of my life
the collective “ooooo” my theater let out when the ‘alex’ chapter card hit the screen is what the cinematic experience is all About
average week in the great commonwealth of Pennsylvania
really wanted to like this more
It sadly didn’t live up to the hype for me
I should give this one star
Such a frustrating film
It keeps piling on fears it canny manipulates, but it doesn’t have much of an idea of what to do with them
good luck to the rest of the movies releasing this year jesus fucking christ man
Pretty unforgettable movie
improves on the original in pretty much every conceivable way, to no surprise
Apparently there is a level of cynicism that even I cannot get behind
Favorite film of Sundance. Favorite film of the year
Good, but vaporous at the same time
A hauntingly beautiful film
would’ve done numbers on Tumblr
Made with a lot of love
The characterization was pretty strong but there were occasional falters
shouldve cried, bawled, threw up in the cinema but i was yawning
another 2 hours looking at the Mirror
The basic premise of this film is a more dramatic / more interesting version of my life
speechless but not in a good way or in a bad way because I don’t know what to think of this film
