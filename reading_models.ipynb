      "Aspects of José Ramón Larraz’s life & career are the subject of this 74-minute expressionistic documentary. Footage of Larraz in the late 2000s is mixed with film clips, voice over of Larraz discussing events & his feelings, comic book pages given the Ken Burns flare & video footage of Larraz that approximates some elements of his work make up the bulk. No talking heads, no real contextualizing & only a minimum of theorizing on the famed director’s part. I think there must be tons more information on him to weave into a more comprehensive look at his life & career, but I found him poignant & thoughtful as a man decades-removed from a career that was largely dismissed while it was occurring. The footage from his films runs from mediocre to poor due to available materials, but this suited the tone quite well while making me even more excited to revisit much of his work in the wonderful condition currently available. J.R. Larraz died in 2013.\n",

      "This interminable sex comedy makes BILL & TED’S EXCELLENT ADVENTURE look like high art. An old black guy & an old Jewish guy stumble through a strange fog muttering dumb things. Turns out they’re at the gates of heaven & granted one wish. The black guy ends up with a watermelon with antennae that’s attached to a radio dial. Somehow he makes the Jewish guy go back through the ages of time, witnessing sex from perspectives ranging from George Washington to a Viking. There isn’t a ton of sex considering this picture is almost 90 minutes long. The sets are incomplete or sometimes drawn on a wall, which doesn’t end up as charming as it sounds. It’s always nice to see sexploitation regulars Maria Arnold, Rene Bond, Sandy Dempsey, Suzanne Fields & even Ric Lutze, but there just isn’t much meat on this bone. Haims’ first picture, THE JEKYLL & HYDE PORTFOLIO, although technically more inept is a much more entertaining piece of cinema sludge.\n",

      "A pale-faced man draped in blankets stands in front of Halloween decorations, explaining the tradition of visiting the graves of loved ones on November 2nd. He tells three tales of boobs & underwear sex, with ghost attacks, possession & necrophilia. This Spanish SOV effort runs under an hour, has an almost invisible budget & will either tickle your fancy or annoy you to tears. I kept thinking that if the era was different or if someone like Franco or Rollin were behind the camera that I’d have no trouble finding pleasure in this same script. As it is, I can’t even get frustrated with it, since it’s a pure expression of the desire to make a horror movie. On offer are a shower scene, gross stuff, the devil, a Ouija board & definite attention paid to the butts of the actresses, & other topics. All three segments feature walks through a cemetery, but in only two of them is it protracted & during the day.\n",

I love that 12 year-old girls the world over are capable or making fast friends across cultures & holding hands while walking down the street. The only American on the trip that annoyed me was the elderly Boston Republican - her attempt at playing tug of war with the children is such an apt metaphor for how America plays at world politics. The caesarean section with acupuncture anesthetic was so gnarly & unexpected. \"Home on the Range\" sung by a Chinese choir over the closing credits was so touching & unexpected.

      "A righteous crime of passion lands Ryoko (Erina Miyai from ZOOM IN: SEX APARTMENTS, SEX HUNTER, et al) in prison. A few months shy of freedom, a woman from her past joins her in jail, sparking a need for vengeance. This 70-minute sleazer from Nikkatsu delivers essentially all the classic women-in-prison elements, adding menstrual masturbation, the gang rape of a male guard by female inmates & a particular interpretation of pussy-eating. The beginning & end are rather stylish, leaving a midsection that’s not outstanding but delivers on its premise. The score is funky blues & Miyai lends a quiet dignity in the midst of the sludge. I must say, there’s something more than slightly confusing about the crime that gets Ryoko convicted. I backed this sucker up to the beginning just to make sure I wasn’t being inattentive, but sure enough, something doesn’t make sense.

The stiff has a singing magician’s assistant for an estranged wife & Bridges’ girl is an actress who digs speedboats & might not be so keen on his return. This British noir is not gonna blow your socks off, but it’s entertaining enough & runs under 80 minutes. A twist near the end notches things up & the ending itself will either make you grin or throw the remote at the TV. Endfield directed ZULU & MYSTERIOUS ISLAND in the ‘60s.

      "Psychological LGBT coming-of-age focused on trauma, homophobia & a narcissistic parent. Gritty & raw. Only 3 characters and none of them are perfect, but the antagonised one is Wang’s mother. She was very dramatic and constantly spoke like she was in a pantomime - not sure if that was the intention. The slowburn bond between In and Wang felt very real; their long & imaginative conversations, lingering looks and hesitated first meetings. I don’t like the term “daddy issues” but it’s clear with Wang’s unresolved trauma with his late father and his mother’s neglect of him, he’s seeking support from In - however, I do think he is discovering his sexuality in the process and there is actual attraction. Of course, the colouring and cinematography is beautiful in the rural setting of Thailand. It’s so well-made, kind of pretentious when the mother is on screen, but a nice slowburn and I think there should be more coming-of-age dramas like this with unforced chemistry.\n",

Mit dem Schicksalsschlag abgeschlossen hat seitdem weder die junge, alleinerziehende Witwe noch ihr Sohn im Teenageralter. Beide sind in Yuya Ishiis neusten Filmdrama auf der Suche nach Halt und Geborgenheit. Und obwohl die Covid-19-Pandemie nur am Rande in Form allbekannter Sicherheitsvorkehrungen in Erscheinung tritt, spitzt sie die Krisen des Mutter-Sohn-Gespanns vor allem auf finanzieller Ebene zu. \"Rote Zahlen\" ist da nur eine von vielen möglichen Übertragungen, auf die der Titel „A Madder Red“ hindeuten könnte, viele andere Rottöne finden sich außerdem in der Kleidung, den emotionalen Zuständen und der unmittelbaren Umgebung der Figuren wieder. Angestaute Emotionen äußern sich in leisen Dialogszenen oder wenigen ungeduldigen Gefühlsausbrüchen durchaus glaubhaft. Sensibel und spürsinnig eingefangenes Schauspielkino, das sich nicht vor einzelnen Längen bewahren kann, aber seinen mehrschichtigen Figuren durchaus Raum zur Entfaltung bietet.
